I'm a freelance graphic designer that focuses on making creative and innovative designs. I like things that are simple, but clever. I am a team player and know how to improve myself when given feedback. I started with graphic design in high school. Now I study graphic design at a university in Prague and also work on my own. In my free time, when I'm not working on my projects, I like to make hip-hop beats, play guitar and be with my friends. I really love my profession, and I would never change it for anything else
