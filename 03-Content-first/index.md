## DESCRIPTION
Designing logo and packaging for a Czech company, that specializes in manufacturing dietary supplements. It included designing a few package variants and preparation for print. 

## CONTEXT
Minus age is a company, that was founded one year ago.  Founders wanted from me a modern, clean, simple logo and packaging. We had meetings on weekly basis to ensure, we are on the right track towards the finish line. 

## OBJECTIVE
My objective was to make a nice-looking package and a simple, modern logo design. 

## DURATION
This project is still ongoing. I cooperate with the company to this day for nine months now. The company is still coming up with more and more ideas for new products, so we keep in touch.
