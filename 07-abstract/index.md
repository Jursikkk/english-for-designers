# Abstract

This bachelor's thesis deals with the redesign and creation of a new visual identity of a non-governmental non-profit organization, working primarily with families and children. It aims to improve communication with clients and the public and increase the efficiency of the organization's work. For this purpose, the theoretical work describes the foundations and methods in the field of corporate identity and design, which were applied in the practical part of the work. In the practical part, an analysis of the organization's needs was first carried out in order to create a design for a new visual identity that would best meet all the organization's requirements and communicate with their clients and the public. A new visual identity design was then created, which consists of a logo, company colors, typography and graphic elements that are applied to all the organization's materials. The result of the work is a new visual identity that improves communication with clients and the public, increases the efficiency of the organization's work, and strengthens the perception of its mission and values.
