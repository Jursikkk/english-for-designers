# The power of simplicity in graphic design

Slide 1 LOGO

Such as designs like Nike or Apple logo, that we all know

Slide 2 STORY

Once upon a time, graphic design was all about flashy and complex designs. The more elements, colors, and effects a design had, the more impressive it seemed. Designers used to cram every available inch of space with information and visuals, trying to catch the viewer's attention and keep it for as long as possible. This approach created a problem. Designs were to complex, to be easily understood, they failed to communicate

Slide 3 SOLUTION

But then, a new approach emerged. Designers started realizing that complexity didn't always lead to effectiveness. In fact, it often led to confusion and miscommunication. They started experimenting with simpler and cleaner designs, that used less elements and focused on the essentials. This was the beginning of a new era in graphic design, one that valued simplicity and clarity above all.

Slide 4 THE BENEFITS OF THE SIMPLE DESIGNS

Clarity: Simple designs make it easier for the audience to understand the message.

Memorability: Simple designs are easier to remember. 

Timelessness: Simple designs are often timeless, meaning that they don't become outdated quickly. Simple designs can last for years and even decades.

Versatility: Simple designs are more versatile and can be used in a lot of contexts.

Impact: Simple designs can be more impactful than complex designs. By eliminating unnecessary elements, the designer can create a design that is more visually striking and captures the audience's attention more easily.

STOP
For instance, the stop sign is a simple, yet powerful design that effectively communicates its message. The bright red color and bold, letters spelling out "STOP" make it easily recognizable and instantly understandable to drivers.

As you can see, this design works the same all around the world. No matter where you live, it is instantly recognisable to everyone.


Slide 5 TIPS FOR CREATING SIMPLE DESIGN

Start with the message you want to convey: Before starting the design process, have a clear understanding of the message you want to communicate.

Use negative space to your advantage: Negative space is the empty space around or between design elements. Use it effectively to create a clean and simple design.

Limit your color palette: Too many colors can be distracting. Stick to a limited color palette to create a more visually appealing design.

Use simple shapes and forms: Complex shapes and forms can make a design appear cluttered and confusing. Stick to simple shapes and forms.

Choose a clear font: The font you choose can impact the readability of your design. Choose a font that is clear and avoid using too many different fonts.

TWITTER
For example, the Twitter logo is a simple and effective design that conveys the message of connection and communication. The bird icon, which is the main element of the logo, is a nod to the concept of tweeting which is associated with birds. The blue color, which is used in the logo, is associated with communication and trust, making it a perfect fit for the message that Twitter wants to convey.


Slide 6 INSTAGRAM
Simplicity doesn't always come naturally. It takes practice, experimentation, and the ability to simplify complex ideas.“

The Instagram logo is a great example of a design that has been simplified over time. When Instagram first launched in 2010, its original logo was a retro-looking camera with a rainbow stripe.The new logo features a simple, flat design with a gradient of colors. The camera icon is still present, but it is now a simplified rather than a detailed illustration. 
Instagram logo redesign is a great example of how simplifying a complex design can make it more effective and memorable.

Slide 7 CONCLUSION
In conclusion, whether you're creating a logo, website, or any other design, keep in mind the power of simplicity. Start with a clear message, use negative space, limit your color palette, and focus on typography. By doing so, you can create designs that are both simple and effective, and that can truly resonate with your audience.
